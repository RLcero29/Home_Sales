In this challenge we use SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. We then used Spark to create temporary views, partition data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and check to see that the table was uncached. Initially running this notebook in Google Colab, the spark version that was in the notebook was a bit outdated so I had to check my recent Colab notebooks from class to verify the new version to run. In this Colab notebook, some code was auto-generated when I typed a bit of code inside each cell. The code sometimes was what I was already thinking so I auto-filled what was in my mind already, and the other times it wasn't aligning with what was in my head, I went and typed out my code.
